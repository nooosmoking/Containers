# s21_containers

Implementation of the s21_containers.h. library.

As part of the project you need to write your own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack` and `vector`. Implementations should provide a full set of standard methods and attributes for element handling, container capacity checking and iteration. As a bonus, you can also implement several other container classes from the C++ container library that are not as commonly used, but differ in their implementation details.
